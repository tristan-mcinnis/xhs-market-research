  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Soft pastel pink frame, cream-highlighted headings and playful star illustrations create a cute, non-threatening aesthetic; tidy vertical layout and sans-serif Chinese text mimic a friendly infographic, easing readibility and intimacy.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: It sells a responsible, health-conscious lifestyle—sexual safety, hygiene, and informed consumption—aligned with 新女性 (new woman) and urban young adult values; the tone balances practicality and cuteness to appeal to millennials/Gen Z who value discretion, aesthetics, and self-care. Target audience: young, educated Chinese consumers comfortable with online health info and lifestyle curation.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Sexual topics are de-stigmatized by domestication—cute colors, euphemistic language (“套套”), checklist format, and emphasis on everyday care (storage, expiration, allergy alternatives) transform taboo into manageable consumer knowledge.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Uses Xiaohongshu trust markers—casual advisory voice, listicle numbering, emoji-like stars and conversational parentheses—to mimic peer recommendations; implies experiential authority rather than clinical expertise, leveraging influencer-like intimacy and UGC aesthetics.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuasion hinges on risk-aversion and self-efficacy: brief actionable tips reduce uncertainty and empower purchase/behavioral decisions, while aesthetic cues lower activation energy to engage with an otherwise sensitive topic.",
