  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Minimal, flat-design aesthetic with high-contrast red and black typography against a creamy background; centered vertical composition guides the eye from a condom-like icon at top to bold quoted “TT” and large Chinese characters, finished with a soft, blushing emoji to soften tone.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: Promotes discreet, modern sexual health/pleasure awareness—blending responsibility with intimacy. Values: safe modernity (科技感 + safety), youthful playfulness, and emotional comfort (羞涩但自信). Target audience: urban, educated young adults (20s–30s), digitally savvy women and couples who seek body-positive but socially acceptable sexual information.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Uses euphemistic visuals (iconography instead of explicit photos), playful typography and emoji to destigmatize sex—framing the topic as lifestyle/self-care rather than moral transgression, thus reducing shame through familiarity and humor.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Employs Xiaohongshu authenticity cues—casual conversational copy, lifestyle framing, and emotive stickers that mimic user-generated posts; the graphic reads like a saved note or tip, signaling peer-to-peer advice from micro-influencers rather than corporate advertising.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuades by normalizing and social-proofing: the design implies communal knowledge (“insider” tip) and low-risk trial (non-threatening visual language), leveraging curiosity and FOMO to convert attention into engagement or product inquiry.",
