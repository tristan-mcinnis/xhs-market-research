  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Bright, high-contrast yellow frame with white interior creates a clean, optimistic aesthetic; modular blocks, dashed separators and icons mimic infographic/educational layouts, emphasizing clarity and trustworthiness.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: Promotes self-care, precision, and modern masculinity—framing product choice as a responsible, technical decision; targets urban Chinese men (and partners researching gifts) who value convenience and normative conformity (“中号” as the safe, typical choice). It also appeals to a health/lifestyle discourse that prioritizes fit and performance.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Sensitive sexual/body topics are medicalized and depersonalized using measurements, clinical language (“标准宽度”, “直径”), and disclaimers (“仅供参考”), which neutralizes embarrassment and reframes the subject as ordinary consumer information rather than intimate content.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Uses Xiaohongshu tropes—informative visuals, step-by-step sizing guide, and reassuring copy—to signal authenticity and usefulness. The layout imitates user-generated advice posts and mini-guides common among KOLs, enhancing perceived peer-to-peer credibility.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Leverages loss-aversion and conformity: fear of choosing wrong (“过大or过小…容易导致‘漏雨’”) plus social proof of the “普遍适用” middle option drives risk-averse purchases; clear metrics reduce cognitive load and justify buying decisions.",
