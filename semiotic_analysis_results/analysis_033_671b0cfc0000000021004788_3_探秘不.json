  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: High-contrast, minimalist composition uses black, gold and silver to signal premium, while soft white background and close-up framing emphasize product texture and tactility; numeric “003” and neat typography create clinical-modern aesthetics.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: The image sells discreet cosmopolitan sexuality and responsible adulthood—combining sensuality with safety (18+ mark, natural rubber note). Target audience: urban young adults (20–35) who value design, self-care, and tasteful consumption; secondary audience: female gatekeepers who curate partners’ responsible behavior.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Sexual content is sanitized via design cues (luxury packaging, poetic Chinese line on box) and euphemistic visual language—focus on object as lifestyle accessory rather than bodily act—normalizing intimacy through aesthetics and product safety framing.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Xiaohongshu cues include product-as-lifestyle shot, close crop for ASMR-like detail, and implied user endorsement (studio-polished but personal angle), aligning with user trust economy and shoppable discovery culture (soft review vibe rather than hard advertising).\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuasion hinges on symbolic consumption—buying status, taste, and moral reassurance (safety + discretion). The design reduces shame and reframes the product as a fashionable, responsible choice.",
