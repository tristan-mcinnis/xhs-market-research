  "analysis": "VISUAL CODES: Soft, pastel-dominant palette (pink packets against a blurred, well-decorated bathroom) and close-up handheld framing create intimacy and domestic luxury. Bold typographic overlays, checkmark badges and sticker-style emojis mimic casual social-media graphics, directing attention to key selling points.\n\nCULTURAL MEANING: The image sells a modern, discreet sexual wellness lifestyle—safe, sensual, and aesthetically pleasing—linking contraception to self-care and romantic play. Target audience: urban millennial/Gen Z consumers (especially women and couples) who value stylish products that fit into curated domestic aesthetics and sexual agency. It signals middle-class consumption, privacy, and tasteful eroticism acceptable within mainstream lifestyle discourse.\n\nTABOO NAVIGATION: Sexual content is sanitized via euphemistic language (flavor, “前戏”/foreplay), cute fruit emoji and pastel visuals that infantilize/soften eroticism, and by framing the product as hygienic and recreational rather than explicit—transforming taboo into wholesome self-care.\n\nPLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Uses Xiaohongshu visual grammar—first-person hand-held shot, dense text overlays, emoji/checkmark seals, and a tiny legal disclaimer—projecting informal authenticity and review-like intimacy. The aesthetic mimics influencer product-recommendation posts to elicit trust.\n\nCONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuasion rests on emotional/aspirational appeal—sensory imagery (strawberry flavor, “soft” texture), lifestyle signaling (stylish bathroom), and social-proof cues that normalize and beautify a stigmatized purchase, reducing friction through desirability and perceived safety.",
