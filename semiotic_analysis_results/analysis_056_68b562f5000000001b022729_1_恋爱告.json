  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Bright, warm orange and yellow dominate, creating energetic, sensual warmth; clean tabletop composition and repeated product shots (boxes + sachets) use symmetry and close-up texture to suggest abundance and tactility. Typography overlays and emoji punctuate informal, mobile-native aesthetics.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: Sells modern, intimate urban lifestyle—playful sexual openness packaged as tasteful, consumer-friendly self-care; aligns with young, bilingual, tech-savvy Chinese millennials/Gen Z seeking discreet enhancement of romantic life. Appeals to values of convenience, novelty (“2025” futurism), and aspirational coupledom (cohabitation, “热恋时刻”).\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Sexual content is de-tabooed by euphemism (“猫舌”/cat’s tongue), cutesy animal motif, clinical-looking boxes, and pharmacy-style packaging that reframes erotic products as normalized health/pleasure goods; emojis and playful copy soften explicitness.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Uses Xiaohongshu signifiers—before/arrangement product shot, casual lifestyle props, stickered text overlays, and conversational Chinese captions—to signal peer recommendation rather than mass advertising; presence of small legal text and brand logo functions as credibility markers.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Leverages social proof and aspirational identity: buying the product promises entry into a modern, sexually confident community; scarcity/novelty cues (limited year “2025”) and tactile imagery trigger impulse and perceived experiential upgrade.",
