  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Bright warm palette (orange, yellow, pink) evokes energy, intimacy, and playfulness; neat product-centered composition with shallow depth and soft props (pillows, crystals) frames items as lifestyle accessories rather than clinical goods.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: Sells modern, discreet sexual wellbeing as part of aspirational urban coupledom—“小情侣”的惊喜感 and novelty. Targets young, middle-class Chinese consumers comfortable with sexual consumption but seeking romance-coded, aesthetically pleasing products (millennials/Gen Z in relationships). Emphasizes quality and safety (Thailand latex import) to reconcile modern desire with cultural emphasis on health/responsibility.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Sexual content is sanitized via euphemistic branding (“Cat’s Tongue”), playful emojis, and domestic, cute staging that reframes condoms as lifestyle gifts; text-heavy badges (360 design, imported latex) shift focus to functionality and quality, defusing explicitness.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Uses Xiaohongshu authenticity markers—product close-ups, multiple angles, lifestyle props, and badge-like claims—mimicking user-review aesthetics. Visuals replicate influencer curation (soft lighting, coordinated color story) to suggest peer recommendation rather than hard advertising.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuasion relies on affective signaling—associating product with romance, novelty, and social-modern identity—combined with trust cues (origin, design features) to reduce purchase anxiety and convert taboo into a fashionable, safe choice.",
