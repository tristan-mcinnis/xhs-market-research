  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Soft pastel gradient (pink-to-lavender) and minimalist layout use a feminine, gentle aesthetic; blocky headings and checklist-style bullets create an orderly, semi-clinical composition that balances playfulness and authority.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: It markets a normalized, health-conscious, sex-positive lifestyle—framing condoms as everyday consumer choices rather than shameful items. Target audience is young, urban Chinese women and couples comfortable with discreet discussion of sex, aesthetics, and self-care. It also signals modernity and consumer literacy (brand/variant choices).\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Sensitive subject matter is domesticated via educational framing (“basic knowledge”), euphemistic language, pastel palette, and checklist format—transforming erotic/medical anxiety into neutral, manageable info.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Uses Xiaohongshu tropes—clean, feed-friendly graphic, watermark/handle for perceived authorship, and checklist tips that mimic influencer “quick guide” posts; these act as authenticity cues (peer advice, lifestyle content rather than hard advertising).\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuasion relies on anxiety reduction and empowerment—informational framing + attractive design builds trust and lowers barriers to purchase by making choice feel informed, safe, and fashionable.",
