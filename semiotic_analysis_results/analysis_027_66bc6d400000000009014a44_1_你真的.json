  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Soft pastel palette (pink, yellow, mint) and rounded kawaii motifs (flower, strawberry, cherub) create a cutesy, non-threatening aesthetic; centered block text with bold headings in comic-like fonts signals accessible infographic composition. The decorative border and stickers mimic scrapbook/diary visual culture.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: The image sells a modern, health-conscious intimate lifestyle that normalizes sexual health within everyday feminine aesthetics; it targets young urban Chinese women (post-90s/00s) who value discretion, cuteness (萌系), and user-friendly knowledge. It frames condom choice as consumer empowerment—safe, informed, and stylish self-care.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Potentially sensitive topics (sex, contraception) are defused through infantilizing/cute semiotics, euphemistic language, and clinical-but-simple explanations, shifting tone from explicit to maternal/educational and thus socially acceptable in mainstream Chinese social media.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Features typical 小红书 cues—personal handle watermark (@小花的恋爱指南), pastel visual branding, short didactic copy, and an influencer-as-friend voice that signals peer expertise and perceived authenticity. The layout imitates experiential lifestyle posts rather than formal medical content.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuasion hinges on reducing cognitive and stigma barriers—cute aesthetics lower anxiety, while clear, bite-sized information and influencer framing build trust and motivate low-effort behavioral change (purchase/try) under the guise of everyday self-care.",
