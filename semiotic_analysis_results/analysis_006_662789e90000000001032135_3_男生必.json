  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Bright yellow frame and headers create high-contrast, optimistic branding; bold red characters for key materials (乳胶, 聚氨酯) function as attention anchors. Clean table grid and sans fonts signal informational, almost infographic-like credibility.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: It sells practical frugality vs. quality discernment—invoking xinsheng (新生活) aspirations for smart consumption. Targets middle-class urban shoppers who value cost-performance and product literacy, especially young homeowners and parenting audiences. It also taps into “comparison culture” (对比消费) common on Xiaohongshu.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Price disparities and brand hierarchy are presented as neutral data rather than moral judgments, softening class sensitivity; politely framed disclaimer (“仅供参考，无不良引导”) diffuses accountability and regulatory risk.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Uses concise visuals, numbered brands, and data tables typical of Xiaohongshu shopping guides. The tone mimics micro-influencer expertise—informational authority without overt celebrity presence—invoking perceived authenticity and peer-to-peer advice.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuasion relies on comparative quantification and scarcity of expert knowledge—presenting numbers creates cognitive ease and motivates purchase decisions through loss aversion (fear of overpaying) and desire for informed agency.",
