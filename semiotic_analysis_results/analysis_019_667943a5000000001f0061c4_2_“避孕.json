  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Pastel pink-to-blue gradient, rounded white card and soft drop shadows create a clean, friendly aesthetic; bold black headline in heavy Chinese type anchors hierarchy while smaller serif-like body text mimics informational pamphlets. Layout balances decorative arrows and icons with modular text blocks, signaling lifestyle content rather than medical formalism.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: The image markets responsible modern sexuality fused with “cute” aesthetics common in Chinese youth culture, selling intimacy as safe, informed, and normalized. It targets urban young women and couples—educated, health-conscious Xiaohongshu users who value discretion and tasteful design. Implicitly appeals to “self-care” and personal agency (自我管理) while avoiding moralizing tones.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Sensitive sexual and disease-related content is softened through pastel colors, emoji-like symbols, and pedagogical framing (“basic knowledge”), transforming taboo into lifestyle knowledge and reducing embarrassment via approachable visual cues.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Uses Xiaohongshu authenticity markers—concise explanatory text, soft lifestyle visuals, and community-friendly tone—suggesting peer-to-peer advice rather than corporate advertising. The layout imitates influencer note cards and review posts common on the platform.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuasion relies on expertise-by-design: authoritative visual hierarchy plus approachable aesthetics create trust and lower resistance, prompting users to accept product-category norms (condoms as mainstream self-care) and consider purchase or behavioral change.",
