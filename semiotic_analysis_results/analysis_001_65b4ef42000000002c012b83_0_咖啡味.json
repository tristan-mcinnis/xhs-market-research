  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Warm coffee-brown palette, glossy swirl and clock numerals create a sensual yet functional aesthetic; centered logo and mascot plus clear typographic hierarchy convey brand familiarity and product benefit at a glance.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: Sells a performance-oriented, discreet modern masculinity—control, endurance, and pleasurable normalcy; aligns with urban young adults seeking enhancement without medicalization. Target audience: sexually active Chinese men (and partners) who value convenience, taste/novelty (coffee flavor), and branded trust.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Uses food imagery (coffee flavor), scientific-sounding phrasing (\"物理延时\"/Natural Lasting) and playful mascot to depathologize sex and avoid explicitness, framing contraception/performance as everyday lifestyle choices rather than intimate taboo.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Screenshot shows Xiaohongshu commerce/UI cues—price, cashback badge, quantity label—mimicking review/shop posts; legitimacy is signaled through clear packaging shots, product close-ups, and brand name prominence rather than personal testimonial in this image.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuades by reducing anxiety and offering control—combining sensory appeal (flavor, warm color) with functional promise (delay) to convert performance concerns into a purchasable, low-stigma solution.",
