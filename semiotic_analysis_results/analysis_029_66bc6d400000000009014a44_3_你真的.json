  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Pastel pink frame, rounded icons (flower, strawberry, cupid) and soft drop shadows create a kawaii, gentle aesthetic; centered text blocks with hierarchical typography (bold yellow headings, gray body copy) simulate an infographic/FAQ. Composition balances cuteness with informational clarity.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: The post commodifies responsible intimacy and “safe, cute” modern femininity—combining health consciousness with lifestyle aesthetics. It targets young urban women (post-90s/00s) who consume wellness content on Xiaohongshu and value discreet, attractive packaging. It sells reassurance: expertise + approachable tone = trustworthy consumption.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Sexual health is de-tabooed via infantilizing/cute visual tropes and soft euphemistic language; clinical details are minimized and framed as friendly tips, making sensitive content socially acceptable under the guise of lifestyle advice.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Uses Xiaohongshu authenticity cues—casual first-person handle (@小花的恋爱指南), conversational tone, and checklist-style guidance that mimics peer recommendations rather than corporate messaging. Visual polish signals influencer curation while pastel aesthetics align with platform aspirational feeds.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuasion relies on emotion + expertise: cute visuals lower resistance, while bulletized “practical” facts build perceived competence and urgency (check dates, use soon), prompting immediate, low‑effort action from followers seeking normative validation.",
