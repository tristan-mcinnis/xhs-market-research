  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Bright yellow and white palette creates a clean, friendly, and optimistic aesthetic; rounded speech-bubble panels and bold headings mimic app UI and poster layouts, prioritizing legibility over photography. Hierarchical typography and ample white space signal modern lifestyle-branding.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: The image sells responsible, empowered intimacy and self-care framed as everyday consumer choice, aligning safety with youthfulness and convenience. Target audience: urban, digitally savvy young adults (post-90s/00s) who value discretion, aesthetics, and product knowledge. It taps Chinese values of prudence and face-saving by presenting private behavior as normalized and non-judgmental.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Sensitive sexual-health topics are de-stigmatized via clinical-sounding terms (“科普”, “过期”), softening language with metaphors (“静静的退休”) and a reassuring, casual tone—transforming potential embarrassment into manageable, everyday advice.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Uses Xiaohongshu markers: FAQ format, conversational copy, and an authoritative-but-relatable voice (“仅供参考”) that mimics influencer-product guides. The layout imitates UGC “note” graphics that signal authenticity and practical tips rather than hard advertising.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuasion leverages trust through education (informational nudging) and social normalization—reducing perceived risk and embarrassment while implying community consensus, which lowers barriers to purchase and encourages brand loyalty.",
