  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Soft pastel gradient (pink to purple) and rounded white text blocks create a reassuring, feminine aesthetic; bold black headline in a condensed, slightly retro display type anchors authority, while orderly bullet-like layout mimics instructional infographics.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: The post sells responsible, informed modern femininity—sexual health framed as manageable, consumerized knowledge—appealing to urban, young adult women who value privacy, safety, and self-optimization. It signals pragmatic intimacy (knowledge = agency) and aligns with mid-class lifestyle aspirations (educated, health-conscious, digitally savvy).\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Sensitive content (condom sizing, sexual failure) is medicalized and de-sexualized via neutral language, measurements, and instructional tone; pastel visuals and emphasis on “don’t force” normalize discussion while deflecting explicitness.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: The slide mimics Xiaohongshu note aesthetics—concise tips, numbered categories, and visually clean cards—evoking peer-to-peer advice. Authenticity markers include practical specifics (mm measurements), cautious disclaimers, and a “first-time choose” line that reads like lived-experience guidance from an influencer or KOL.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuasion relies on competence signaling and risk reduction: concrete metrics + normative warnings reduce uncertainty and anxiety, nudging purchase/trial by promising control, safety, and improved sexual performance.",
