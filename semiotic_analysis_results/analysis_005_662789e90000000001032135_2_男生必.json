  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Bright yellow border and buttons, soft pastels and rounded icons create a friendly, non-threatening clinical look; playful anthropomorphized rulers and tape-measure illustrations add kawaii charm. Composition uses clear vertical sections and numbered steps for easy skimming.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: The post domesticates a private/sexual concern into everyday self-care and measurable data, reflecting contemporary Chinese youth emphasis on quantification and self-improvement (打卡/测评 culture). It sells a lifestyle of pragmatic, discreet problem‑solving and “responsible” masculinity—targeting young urban men who use Xiaohongshu for lifestyle tips and anxious consumers seeking low-stigma advice. The tone mixes authority with friendliness to signal both expertise and peer relatability.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Sensitive sexual content is defused through medicalized language (“测量”、“科普”), cute visuals, and an explicit disclaimer (“仅供参考，无不良引导”), which reframes the topic as harmless, educational, and non-sexual, minimizing moral panic.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Uses Xiaohongshu signifiers—step-by-step checklist, emoji-like badges, lifestyle photography aesthetics, and an informal advisory voice—mimicking influencer/UGC authenticity. The combination of visuals and casual pedagogy signals grassroots expertise rather than formal advertising.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuasion hinges on anxiety reduction and normalization: concrete actionable steps + friendly visuals lower emotional barriers, making the user feel competent and safe to act, which increases trust and likelihood of engagement or product interaction.",
