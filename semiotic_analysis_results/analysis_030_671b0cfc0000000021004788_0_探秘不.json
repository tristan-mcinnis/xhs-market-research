  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Bright, warm red-orange dominates with a sunburst gradient and bold “003” numerals, creating high visibility and commodity clarity; flatlay composition and shallow depth emphasize texture (boxed vs. foil) and suggest both intimacy and everyday accessibility.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: The image markets a modern, risk-aware sexual lifestyle that values safety, pleasure, and aesthetic taste—tying condom choice to self-care and sophistication. Target audience: urban Millennials/Gen Z Chinese consumers comfortable with sexual autonomy but seeking discreet, stylish products. It also signals aspirational couple-dom and casual confidence rather than stigma-laden or clinical framings.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Sexuality is normalized via design and euphemistic visual language—bright, friendly colors and cartoon-like iconography soften explicitness; product is framed as lifestyle accessory instead of illicit subject, reducing embarrassment and moral friction.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: The Xiaohongshu flatlay, carefully staged lighting, and close-up detail function as authenticity markers (user-tested, “lived” product shot). Implicit influencer cues—neat composition, aspirational minimalism, and visible unit count/age-limit icon—mimic native review posts and micro-influencer recommendations common on 小红书.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Core persuasion blends social-proof normalization with identity signaling—buying this product communicates modernity, taste, and responsible intimacy, converting taboo attenuation into a lifestyle purchase.",
