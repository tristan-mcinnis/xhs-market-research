  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Soft pastel gradient (pink-to-blue) and minimal sans-serif typography create a gentle, non-threatening aesthetic; centered column layout, bold headline and underlined phrases direct attention to key claims, while a faint watermark/handle signals authorship.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: The image sells a hygiene-and-responsibility lifestyle—modern, health-conscious urban youth (especially women) who value safety, quality control, and informed consumption; it invokes contemporary Chinese notions of “精致生活” (exquisite living) and discreet self-care; tone balances clinical authority with approachable aesthetics to normalize condom use.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Sexual content is depersonalized and medicalized—textual explanation, absence of sexual imagery, pastel “cute” palette, and rational tips transform a taboo topic into acceptable consumer advice, reducing embarrassment and stigma.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Xiaohongshu cues appear: personal/brand watermark (@GANGUAN 感官方案), stepwise explanatory copy, bold/underlined emphasis, and lifestyle-frame rather than pure advertising—mimicking authentic user-advice posts to leverage perceived trust and peer recommendation.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: The primary persuasion is risk-reduction and reassurance—combining authoritative information with relatable aesthetics to lower cognitive and social barriers, prompting purchase/use through safety, expertise, and social-normalization signals.",
