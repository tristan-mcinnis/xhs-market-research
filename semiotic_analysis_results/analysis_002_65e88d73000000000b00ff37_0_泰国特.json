  "analysis": "1) VISUAL CODES: Bright, pastel-inflected flatlay with clean white background and succulents; product close-ups held by manicured hand create boutique, lifestyle aesthetic. Warm lighting, neat framing and consistent typography overlays (Chinese + Thai flag) signal curated collection.\n\n2) CULTURAL MEANING: Sells a modern, health-conscious yet playful sexual lifestyle—safe pleasure framed as beauty/wellness rather than taboo. Appeals to young urban Chinese women and couples who value aesthetic consumption, cross-border novelty (Thai origin) and discreet luxury. Leverages aspirational “小资” (petite-bourgeois) sensibility: tasteful, curated, Instagrammable everyday items.\n\n3) TABOO NAVIGATION: Uses euphemistic cues (floral/fruity flavor labels, snack-like jars, cute cartoons) and kawaii packaging to infantilize and de-sexualize the product, reducing stigma. Emphasis on design, health brands (Durex), and consumer choice reframes sex as normalized self-care.\n\n4) PLATFORM CONVENTIONS: Xiaohongshu markers: first-person hand-held shots, product variety grid, checklist/emoji overlays, and short Chinese captions—signals user-generated authenticity and discovery. The aesthetic mimics influencer curation to produce trust via perceived peer recommendation.\n\n5) CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY: Persuades through aspirational identification and social proof—if influencers/peers present sex-care as fashionable and safe, consumers adopt it to align with modern, tasteful identity; novelty (Thai-import) and sensory cues (flavor/icons) trigger impulse and curiosity.",
