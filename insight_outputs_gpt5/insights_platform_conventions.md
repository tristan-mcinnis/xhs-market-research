# PLATFORM CONVENTIONS - Insights

*Analyzed 60 documents*

# 1. KEY PATTERNS (≈150 words)
- UGC/Influencer mimicry: almost every post adopts first‑person or peer‑to‑peer cues — hand‑held shots, casual overlay captions, emoji, “diary” framing, @handles and conversational Mandarin — to simulate authenticity (Docs 2, 3, 12, 15).  
- Educational micro‑content: repeated use of mini‑guides, step‑by‑step sizing/instructional frames, FAQ or checklist formats, and “仅供参考” disclaimers position posts as helpful advice rather than hard ads (Docs 4, 5, 8, 9).  
- Polished-but-casual aesthetic: visual polish (flat‑lays, neat typography, lifestyle props like bubble tea/manicure) is paired with colloquial voice to signal aspirational yet relatable recommendation (Docs 11, 13, 14).  
- Comparative shopping signals: numbered lists, pros/cons, brand tables, price/cashback badges and visible packaging details (expiry, small boxes) create credibility and trialability, blending commerce cues with UGC trust signals (Docs 1, 6, 7, 11).

# 2. DISTINCTIVE ELEMENTS (≈100 words)
- Non‑traditional authority: many posts use “nonce” credibility devices — “正经科普”, “仅供参考”, guide/FAQ framing — to sound expert without formal accreditation (Docs 3, 7, 8, 9).  
- Commerce-UI mimicry: screenshots that echo Xiaohongshu shopping badges (price, cashback) or shop-like layouts are used inside UGC‑style notes to bridge discovery and purchase (Doc 1).  
- Trialability cues: showing small‑quantity boxes, expiry dates, and packaging close‑ups reduces purchase risk and signals honest disclosure (Doc 11). Successful posts balance editorial polish with signals of everyday use and disclosure.

# 3. CULTURAL INSIGHTS (≈100 words)
- Social proof matters more than hard advertising: Chinese consumers on Xiaohongshu privilege peer recommendation, lived experience, and KOC/KOL curation over traditional ads, so brands must fit into communal conversation.  
- Practicality + aesthetics: shoppers want both useful, actionable information (how‑to, sizing, comparisons) and lifestyle aspiration — attractive visuals function as class and trust signals.  
- Platform norms shape form: Xiaohongshu’s note format, save/share behavior, and influencer economy push brands to package marketing as micro‑knowledge, checklistable advice, and collectible thumbnails that perform well in feeds.

# 4. STRATEGIC CODEBOOK (≈150 words)
1. Adopt UGC framing: use first‑person captions, hand‑held or casual shots, emoji and a diary tone. Example: “我用了一个月，感受是…” with a product-in-hand photo.  
2. Ship micro‑education: create 3–6 step guides, sizing charts, or FAQs with a “仅供参考” line to feel helpful, not pushy. Example: “如何选码：1‑3步骤 + 尺码表.”  
3. Show physical proof: include packaging close‑ups (expiry, batch), small trial pack shots and flat‑lays to signal honesty and trialability.  
4. Use comparative formats: numbered pros/cons, brand rankings or data tables to convey research-backed authority without celebrity.  
5. Blend polish + casual: pair attractive lifestyle props/clean typography with colloquial copy for relatable aspiration.  
6. Leverage commerce cues subtly: display price/cashback or limited‑quantity badges inside UGC frames to reduce friction to purchase.  
7. Create community hooks: end with membership/“daily tips” promise or saveable thumbnails to drive saves, follows and reposts.
